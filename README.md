# loginCode
Contains code to Login, Retrieve Password, Register using a CSV file

There are 4 options


1.Login
2.Register
3.Forgot Password
4.Exit

I have also attached the CSV file that consins only two columns login and password.

When you Login, it checks if the user is there
When you registers it checks for email is as per the format and password contains one small, one upper and one numner and one special char and also the length should be bettween 6 to 16 chars

Happy Coding
